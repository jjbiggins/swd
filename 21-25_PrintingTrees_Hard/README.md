# 21-25_PrintingTrees_Hard

## Problem Statement
To write a program that took an array of numbers and sorted them into a binary search tree. Once the binary search tree was created, the program was to output the image of it to the console; additionally, the program was to create a GUI to have the same tree's image displayed for the user.

## Developer Documentation
The program contained three main classes, Tree, TreeNode and TreeGUI, and a driver class. Tree created the binary tree object, it used TreeNode objects, using the TreeNode class, to build the binary tree. It is here, Tree class, where the implementation for the recursive outputTree method. While that method re-cursed, a GUI built to display the tree; in addition, to output the tree to the console.

## User Documentation
Once the program runs, the binary tree's data values will be randomly generated. They will then be inserted into the tree. The user will then be displayed an image of that tree.
